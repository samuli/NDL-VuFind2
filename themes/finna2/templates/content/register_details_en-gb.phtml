  <h3>3. Name of the register</h3>
  <p>User register for the Finna search portal</p>

  <h3>4. Purpose and justification for the use of personal information</h3>
  <p>We use your personal information to maintain the unique identity of our customers and to identify users when they log onto Finna. We also use personal information to be able to provide users with customer services and personalized services on Finna. An example of a personalized service is the new entry alerts service that allows users to receive emails about new references related to their searches. Information is collected and managed for the execution of the Finna service at the National Library of Finland and CSC – IT Centre for Science (service providers).</p>
  <p>Additionally, we use the personal data of our users to monitor the use of the service via an analytical system. The analytical system used in our usage analyses is configured to anonymize the user's IP address by resetting the last two octets of the IP address to zero. We use the analytical system on the servers of CSC - IT Centre for Science so that tracking data cannot be leaked out of this safe environment.</p>
  <p>When logging onto this online service, information about the event (e.g. the user’s IP address) is stored temporarily for processing.</p>
  <p>This processing of personal data is based on the legitimate interest of the data controller.</p>
